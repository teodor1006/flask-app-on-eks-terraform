## **Prerequisites** 

(Things to have before starting the projects)

- [x]  AWS Account.
- [x]  Programmatic access and AWS configured with CLI.
- [x]  GitBash installed.
- [x]  Python3 Installed.
- [x]  Code editor of your choice (VSCode)
- [x]  Terraform installed.

# Letâ€™s Start the Project 

## **Part 1: Deploying the Flask application locally**

### **Step 1: Clone the code**

Clone the code from the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/teodor1006/flask-app-on-eks-terraform.git
```

### **Step 2: Install dependencies**

The application uses the **`psutil`** and **`Flask`, Plotly, boto3** libraries. Install them using pip:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Run the application**

To run the application, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following command:

```
python3 app.py
```

This will start the Flask server on **`localhost:5000`**. Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) on your browser to access the application.

## **Part 2: Create a IAM User on AWS**

### **Step 1: Create IAM User**

```
Name: <name>
Set Permissions -> Attach Policies directly -> Administrator Access
```

### **Step 2: Create Access Key for IAM User**
After creating the IAM User -> click on it and go to Security Credentials -> Create Access Key -> Download it and remember where you store it

## **Part 3: Launch an EC2 Instance for Docker**
```
Name: docker
Ubuntu 22.04 Free Tier eligible
Instance type: t2.micro
Create new key pair and store it in your project folder
Create security group:
  Name: docker-sg
  Description: Security Group for Docker
  Inbound rules: SSH 22 from MyIP
```

## **Part 4: Installing Docker**

### **Step 1: Configure AWS CLI & Clone Repository**
After your EC2 Instance is up and running, go to your project folder and open gitbash:

```
ssh -i <your key name.pub> ubuntu@<your ipv4 address from the EC2 Instance>
Click on yes

sudo -i
apt update & apt install awscli -y
aws configure
  AWS Access Key ID: <your id>
  AWS Secret Access Key: <your secret key>
  Default region name: <your region>
  Default output format: json

git clone https://github.com/teodor1006/flask-app-on-eks-terraform.git  
```

### **Step 2: Install Docker**
Copy and paste this code in gitbash (your running EC2 Instance). Make sure you switched to root user.

```
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

To check if you installed docker correctly run the following command:
```
systemctl status docker
```
You should see that the docker is active running!


## **Part 5: Dockerizing the Flask application**

### **Step 1: Create a Dockerfile**

Create a **`Dockerfile`** in the root directory of the project with the following contents:

```
# Use the official Python image as the base image
FROM python:3.9-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Set the environment variables for the Flask app
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Expose the port on which the Flask app will run
EXPOSE 5000

# Start the Flask app when the container is run
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

### **Step 2: Create an ECR Repository using Python (Boto3)**
Reminder: make sure you have awscli configured on your local machine before running this code

```
import boto3

ecr_client = boto3.client('ecr')

repository_name = "my_monitoring_app_image"
response = ecr_client.create_repository(repositoryName=repository_name)

repository_uri = response ['repository']['repositoryUri']
print(repository_uri)
```
After running this code -> Go to AWS ECR -> Repositories and you should see your created repo

![ecr-repo](images/ecr-repo.png)

### **Step 3: Push the Docker Image to ECR by following these push commands**
Push the commands in gitbash where you installed Docker

![commands](images/push-commands.png)

After pushing the Docker Image you should see it:

![ecr-image](images/ecr-image.png)

## **Part 6: Create EKS Cluster using Terraform**

### **Step 1: Create S3 Bucket**
Go to AWS S3 -> Create bucket -> Give it a unique name -> Keep the rest as default 
Make sure to update the name of your bucket and region in the terraform.tf file

![bucket](images/s3-bucket.png)

### **Step 2: Run the EKS Cluster**
Run the following commands in gitbash:

```
terraform init
terraform fmt -check
terraform validate
terraform plan -out planfile
terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false -parallelism=1 planfile
```

Allow up to 15 minutes for the bucket creation process to complete!!!
After that you should see your keyfile in the S3 Bucket.

### **Step 3: Create Deployment and Service yaml File for K8s**

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-flask-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-flask-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-flask-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-flask-container
        image: "865893227318.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my_monitoring_app_image:latest"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-flask-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-flask-app
  ports:
  - port: 5000
```

Make sure to change the image URI with yours.

### **Step 4: Deploy the App on K8s**

Configure 'kubectl' on AWS EKS by running the following command:

```
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <your region> --name <your cluster name>
```
After that run the following commands:

```
kubectl apply -f dep-serv.yaml
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get pods
kubectl get service
```
Once your pod is up and running, run the port-forward to expose the service:

```
kubectl port-forward service/<service name> 5000:5000
```
Go to your browser and type: localhost:5000
You should be able to see your deployed app!!!

## **Part 7: Delete the EKS Cluster**

Run the following command:

```
terraform destroy -auto-approve -input=false -parallelism=1 planfile
```
